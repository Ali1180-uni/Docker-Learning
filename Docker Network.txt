Basiclly Docker Network are used to connect the container with eachother which can be check by the 
-> docker network ls

C:\Users\Alirehmani>docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
df58dffee4a5   bridge    bridge    local
e15bc72cde12   host      host      local
e642b8d6cbc0   none      null      local

Here we can se How these containers are connected with eachother and at where are they hosted

We can also create a specific Network for our own container
-> docker network create Ali-mongo

C:\Users\Alire>docker network create Ali-mongo
ff1959529f6128ab4ee1d6468f176ade74c75340160d3fc9a0a61fe09037c492

C:\Users\Alire>docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME        DRIVER    SCOPE
ff1959529f61   Ali-mongo   bridge    local
df58dffee4a5   bridge      bridge    local
e15bc72cde12   host        host      local
e642b8d6cbc0   none        null      local

There is the concept of layers in the Docker 

container  // changable
   |
Layer 2   //read-only
   |
Layer 1    // read-only
   |
Base Layer

So when we are trying to donwload some different version of same image it just donwload the specific layers which are not present

Ports: 
There are also some Ports with each container on which they are running
Machine Ports are Different and Container Ports are different
eg:
-> using mysql in 3306 [1]
-> using mysql:8.0 in 3306 [2]
So they are using the same port but not from machine but their indivisual Ports

So if we want to connect the port of container with machine port 
just because when the client request from port 8080 of machine it transfered to 3306 of container for development
This process is called port binding and it is very important

// now we never allocate the 8080 with any other container bcz it is our machine port
-> docker run -p8080:3306 image-name
-> docker run -d -e MY_SQL_PASSWORD=password --name HiAli -p8080:3306 mysql

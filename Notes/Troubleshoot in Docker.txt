 To checkout the errors and also to check the run flow of the image:
 -> docker logs ContainerID
 -> docker exec -it ContainerID/bin/bash
 -> docker exec -it ContainerID/bin/sh
 These Comands are used to access the advance directories of the Specific Container like env 
 And This we can easily access the core files to checkout the specific files or data like versions

 Docker vs Virtual Machine:
 Docker images are basically made up for linix and with the help of docker desktop we can use them in windows and also docker can only 
 virtualize the application layer but the virtual machine can virtualize both OS kernel thats why it is lightweight but have less power than VM


 Docker performance is better on linix and also we must prefer the docker on linix at production
 Docker Desktop is like the small VM on windows to run th docker images

Now we are Working with Specific Network we created Ali-mongo and now we are setup our mongoDb in it:
Now when we are trying to setup mongoDb we must also define some important parameter with it also run in the detach mode

like: 
docker run -d \  -> to run in background/detach mode
-p27017:27017 \  -> specific port for mongoDb
--name mongo \  -> specific container name
--network Ali-mongo \  -> network in which we want to create it
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -> indivisual username
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=qwerty  -> specific password
mongo 


docker run -d -p27017:27017 --name mongo --network Ali-mongo -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=qwerty mongo 

this is the complete cmd to make the specific containerod mongoDb on specific network

-> So we can also create a .yaml file in which we define this whole comands easily instead of the terminal this file is created in the folder where index.js present

docker-compose -f filename.yaml up -d // Used to run this file up means make container and start
docker-compose -f filename.yaml down // means delete this container permanently

in .yaml file how much containers we create docker can specifically create the new network first and transfer them there

open express-mongo on localhost 8081 and add admin & pass there in feilds

Basically Docker is the Tool which helps to make the container with Specific Image Files
-> It helps to Wrap up your application with Dependencies and you can run it anywhere
-> Install Docker Desktop AMD64 first and write docker in cmd to verify
-> DockerHub is the the platform like Github where we Find the images like Github codes
-> Docker is similar to virtual machines but lightweight

Basic Comands: 
-> To Pull the Docker images: docker pull image-name
-> To Pull the Specific Docker images: docker pull image-name:specific version
-> check the images: docker images 
---> Tags are defined as the version of the specific image
-> To Make the Container of image: docker run image-name
-> To Make the Container run in background of image: docker run -d image-name

-> To check How much Containers are running: docker ps -a
-> To use directly the input-output resources: docker run -it image-name

-> to check the running containers: docker ps

-> To start the Container: docker start ContainerName or ContainerID
-> To stop the Container: docker stop ContainerName or ContainerID

// To delete the Image we must delete its container first if it is created
-> To remove the Docker image: docker rmi image-name/ID
-> To remove the Docker Container: docker rm ContainerName/ID

we can also add the environmental variables with our container
-> docker run my-sql -e MY_SQL_PASSWORD = password 

-> This is how we can give the specific name to a Container: docker run --name HiAli hello-world

First output:
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
